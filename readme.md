# Creating New Commands

To create a new command in Raw MD, you need to follow these simple steps:

1. Go to the `src/commands/` directory and find or create an appropriate folder for the category of the command you want to add.

2. In the folder, create a new file named `command.ts`.

3. Export the following variables in the file:

```ts
export const name = ""; // name is what will be used on (PREFIX)name
export const description = ""; // description is what will be shown on the help command
export const alias = []; // Optional which can be used as an alternative name
```

4. Import the following:

```ts
import {Message} from "@open-wa/wa-automate";
import {Client} from "../../util/extend/Client";
```

5. Export a function that will execute the command. The template for the function should look like this:

```ts
export async function run(client:Client, message:Message) {
// Your code here
}
```

6. Your function should ideally return `void`.

Once you have completed these steps, your command is ready to use. You can now use it in the chat by typing `PREFIX` followed by the name of the command. If you want to see a list of available commands, you can type `PREFIX help` in the chat.
